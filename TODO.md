# for now
[X] shuffle a deck
[-] organize the players as they enter, when 2 are in go to the game
[-] send the info of the associated cards, to each player (for now 4 or less)


# server

## stores
I want the server to store all the info, so that the client can't just send bullshit.

# client
maybe cute a ncurses client
but for now the server is the most important
